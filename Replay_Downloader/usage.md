The code works as follows:

Users insert the API key they get from [Ballchasing.com](https://ballchasing.com/upload) after signing in.

Then, users insert the group they want to download. Ballcahsing website has a feature where users can organize their replay files using folders called groups. Groups can have other groups as their child but the replay files can only be found on the leaf-child group. Luckily, all the esports replay files can be found on the site organized [here](https://ballchasing.com/groups?creator=76561199225615730) and [here](https://ballchasing.com/groups?creator=76561199022336078).

Lastly, users put the name of the group and insert the desired directory they want the folder replays to be in then run the code. The code is written so that it automatically creates the folders with their group names and puts the replay files in their respective folders.

A log summary of the download process will be placed inside the root folder.
